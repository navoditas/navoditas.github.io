# Bio

I am a first-year PhD student at MIT, advised by [Prof. Pulkit Agrawal](https://people.csail.mit.edu/pulkitag/). 

Prior to this, I was a Research Engineer at Google DeepMind, where my work spanned a variety of research areas. My latest research involved developing differentially private algorithms for offline reinforcement learning, in collaboration with [Dr. Alekh Agarwal](https://alekhagarwal.net), [Dr. Abhradeep Guha Thakurta](https://athakurta.squarespace.com) and [Dr. Christoph Dann](https://cdann.net). In the past, I have worked on developing solutions for learning from aggregated data to preserve data privacy, mentored by [Dr. Aravindan Raghuveer](https://research.google/people/107631/), [Dr. Rishi Saket](https://research.google/people/107857/) and [Dr. Karthikeyan Shanmugan](https://research.google/people/KarthikeyanShanmugam/).

My past research also includes [automated discovery of interpretable policies from neuroscience data](https://deepmind.google/research/publications/automated-discovery-of-interpretable-cognitive-programs-underlying-reward-guided-behavior/), and exploring how reinforcement learning can facilitate continual learning in LLM agents.

Before this role, I was an intern at Google Research where I worked with [Dr. Aravindan Raghuveer](https://research.google/people/107631/) and [Prof. Balaraman Ravindran](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/) on Imitation Learning. Prior to this, I interned at Viterbi School of Engineering USC where, under the guidance of [Prof. Xiang Ren](https://shanzhenren.github.io), I worked on Time Series prediction using Knowledge Graphs.

I completed my Dual Degree (Bachelors + Masters) in Computer Science and Engineering from [Indian Institute of Technology, Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in). My Dual Degree Thesis, under the guidance of [Prof. Balaraman Ravindran](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/), focused on Imitation Learning for multi-agent Traffic Signal Control.
