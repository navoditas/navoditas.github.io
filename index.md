# Bio

I am a Pre-Doctoral Researcher at [Google Research India](https://research.google/locations/india/), working in the Advertising Sciences Team mentored by [Dr. Rishi Saket](https://research.google/people/107857/) and [Dr. Aravindan Raghuveer](https://research.google/people/107631/). My work focuses on developing an understanding of the learnability of aggregate data and the privacy afforded by forming such aggregations. My CV is available <a href="https://anand-10-prog.github.io/img/Anand_CV_final.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

I am broadly interested in Learning Theory, Generalization, Differential Privacy and Fairness in Machine Learning. I want to develop a more abstract understanding of learning algorithms and how these relate to deeper concepts in Mathematics.

Previously, I was a Research Intern at Adobe Research, Bengaluru. I worked with [Dr. Shiv Kumar Saini](https://research.adobe.com/person/shiv-kumar-saini/) and [Dr. Atanu R Sinha](https://research.adobe.com/person/atanu-sinha/) on developing methods for fairer Cloud Resource Allocation.

I graduated from [Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/) in 2022. I completed my undergraduate thesis under the guidance of [Prof. Parag Singla](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~parags/) and [Prof. Mausam](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~mausam/). The focus of my research there was to identify reasons and figure out ways to mitigate "Bias Amplification in Deep Networks". I was also mentored by [Prof. Amitabha Tripathi](https://web.iitd.ac.in/~atripath/) with whom I did a summer project on Graph Labelings.
