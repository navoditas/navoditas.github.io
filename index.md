# Bio

I am a Research Engineer at Google DeepMind. My research interests lie primarily in the area of Reinforcement Learning and its applications.

My latest research involved developing differentially private algorithms for offline reinforcement learning, in collaboration with [Dr. Alekh Agarwal](https://alekhagarwal.net), [Dr. Abhradeep Guha Thakurta](https://athakurta.squarespace.com) and [Dr. Christoph Dann](https://cdann.net).

Currently, I'm exploring how reinforcement learning can facilitate continual learning in LLM agents. I’m also working on using RL techniques for generating synthetic data to train LLMs.

Additionally, I’m involved in a project aimed at automating the discovery of interpretable policies from neuroscience data. In the past, I have worked on developing solutions for learning from aggregated data to preserve data privacy, mentored by [Dr. Aravindan Raghuveer](https://research.google/people/107631/), [Dr. Rishi Saket](https://research.google/people/107857/) and [Dr. Karthikeyan Shanmugan](https://research.google/people/KarthikeyanShanmugam/).

Before this role, I was a Research Intern at Google Research India. I worked with [Dr. Aravindan Raghuveer](https://research.google/people/107631/) and [Prof. Balaraman Ravindran](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/) on Imitation Learning in the absence of environmental access. Prior to this, I interned at Viterbi School of Engineering USC where, under the guidance of [Prof. Xiang Ren](https://shanzhenren.github.io), I worked on Time Series prediction using Knowledge Graphs.

I completed my Dual Degree (Bachelors + Masters) in Computer Science and Engineering from [Indian Institute of Technology, Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in) in 2021. My Dual Degree Thesis, under the guidance of [Prof. Balaraman Ravindran](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/), focused on Behavioral Cloning for multi-agent Traffic Signal Control.
